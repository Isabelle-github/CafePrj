                <h1>Our Story</h1>
                <p>I started my first coffee shop in 2004 in Hampstead Garden Suburbs after deciding to give up my 9 to
                    5
                    job in the city. With no catering experience, the only way I knew how to operate a business was NOT
                    to
                    look at it as a business. I treated it like my home and all the customers were guests in my home.
                </p>
                <p>
                    After 13 years, I still stand by the same principle as I have not yet learnt the art of the business
                    but
                    have mastered the art of being a host. We buy the best fresh ingredients and cook the food I serve
                    to my
                    family at home. Everything is freshly cooked on site and served immediately to our guests.

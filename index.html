            <p>We are more than your normal coffee shop; we are a part of your everyday lives. Our passion and love of
                home-cooked meal is portrayed in every dish we serve.

                and smoothies. And last but by far not the least, we have freshly baked cakes which will put a smile on
                your face.

            <h1>Our Story</h1>
            <p>I started my first coffee shop in 2004 in Hampstead Garden Suburbs after deciding to give up my 9 to 5
                job in the city. With no catering experience, the only way I knew how to operate a business was NOT to
                look at it as a business. I treated it like my home and all the customers were guests in my home.
                After 13 years, I still stand by the same principle as I have not yet learnt the art of the business but
                have mastered the art of being a host. We buy the best fresh ingredients and cook the food I serve to my
                family at home. Everything is freshly cooked on site and served immediately to our guests.
